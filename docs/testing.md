Testing
-------
Running the MultiScanner test suite is fairly straight forward. We use the [pytest framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), which you can install by running ```$ pip install pytest```.

After that, simply cd into the top level multiscanner directory and run the command: ```$ pytest```

This will automatically find all the tests in the tests/ directory and run them. We encourage developers of new modules and users to contribute to our testing suite!
