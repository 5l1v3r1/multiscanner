Configuration Options
---------------------

General
^^^^^^^
- **path** - This is where the executable is located.
- **cmdline** - This is an array of command line options be to passed to the executable.
- **host** - This is the hostname, port, and username of the machine that will be SSHed into to run the analytic if the executable is not present on the local machine.
- **key** - This is the SSH key to be used to SSH into the host.
- **replacement path** - If the main config is set to copy the scanned files this will be what it replaces the path with. It should be where the network share is mounted.
- **ENABLED** - When set to false the module will not run.

[main]
^^^^^^
This is the configuration for the main script

- **copyfilesto** - This is where the script will copy each file that is to be scanned. This can be removed or set to False to disable this feature.
- **group-types** - This is the type of analytics to group into sections for the report. This can be removed or set to False to disable this feature.

.. _mod-avg-2014:

[AVGScan]
^^^^^^^^^
This module scans a file with AVG 2014 anti-virus.

.. _mod-clamav:

[ClamAVScan]
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module scans a file with ClamAV.

.. _mod-cuckoo:

[Cuckoo]
^^^^^^^^
This module submits a file to a Cuckoo Sandbox cluster for analysis.

- **API URL** - This is the URL to the API server
- **timeout** - This is max time a sample with run for
- **running timeout** - This is an additional timeout, if a task is in the running state this many seconds past **timeout** we will consider the task failed.
- **delete tasks** - When set to True, tasks will be deleted from cuckoo after detonation. This is to prevent filling up the Cuckoo machine's disk with reports.
- **maec** - When set to True, `MAEC <https://maecproject.github.io>`_ JSON report is added to Cuckoo JSON report. *NOTE*: Cuckoo needs MAEC reporting enabled to produce results.

.. _mod-exiftools:

[ExifToolsScan]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module scans the file with Exif tools and returns the results.

- **remove-entry** - A python list of ExifTool results that should not be included in the report. File system level attributes are not useful and stripped out.

.. _mod-fireeye:

[FireeyeScan]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module uses a FireEye AX to scan the files. It uses the Malware Repository feature to automatically scan files. This may not be the best way but it does work. It will copy the files to be scanned to the mounted share folders.
*NOTE*: This module is suuuuuper slow

- **base path** - The mount point where the fireeye images folders are
- **src folder** - The folder name where input files are put
- **fireeye images** - A python list of the VMs in fireeye. These are used to generate where to copy the files.
- **enabled** - True or False

- **cheatsheet** - Not implemented yet

.. _mod-floss:

[floss]
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module extracts ASCII, UTF-8, stack and obfuscated strings from executable files. More information about module configuration can be found at the `flare-floss <https://github.com/fireeye/flare-floss/blob/master/doc/usage.md>`_ documentation.
